          <h2>Hello! ðŸ‘‹</h2>
          <p>
            I'm Harish Manoharan, a Master's student in Computer Science at the University of Texas at Dallas,
            maintaining a perfect 4.0 GPA as a Dean's Graduate Scholar.
          </p>
          <p>
            My journey in technology started at IIT Madras, where I completed an Integrated Dual Degree
            in Data Science and Biological Sciences. This unique combination sparked my interest in applying
            computational techniques to solve complex real-world problems.
          </p>
          <p>
            I'm passionate about building intelligent systems that leverage AI and machine learning. My work spans
            from developing multi-agent AI systems and full-stack applications to conducting research in bioinformatics
            and computer vision. I thrive on solving challenging problems and creating solutions that make a tangible impact.
